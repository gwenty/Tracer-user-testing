## Goal of the tool
The goal of this tool is to instrument a Java program so that it will produce execution traces when run. The produced traces can  for instance keep track of which methods were called and what values were sent when the program ran. This can then be used for program analysis such as finding bugs.
## User survey
Please try using the tool following the instructions below. Then answer some short questions in this form: https://forms.gle/o7RS2b1SeiQedTZx6

There are two example programs to instrument. Example program 1 is a small program from http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=j713/d2x.java that processes railway statistics and is run using the RunStationStatistics class. Example program 2 is Commons Lang (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) and is accompanied by a set of JUnit tests and RunSomeTests.class that will run the tests and save the trace of each test to a file. The traces of passing and failing tests will be saved to the appropriate pass/fail folder which  are created when running RunSomeTests.

Give it a good try but if it doesnâ€™t work, please do still fill out the form.
## Running the tracing tool

You will need Java to run the tool. It is compiled with Java 8 and should also work with later versions.

1.	Download the tracing tool.

2.	Try running the programs to be traced from the command line. 

    Example program 1: \
		Linux: java -cp classes:. RunStationStatistics rstats2019.xyz \
		Windows: java -cp "classes;." RunStationStatistics rstats2019.xyz
	
	Example program 2: \
	    Linux : java -cp junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0.jar:.:classes:test-classes/ RunSomeTests \
	    Windows: java -cp "junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0.jar;.;classes;test-classes/" RunSomeTests
	
	Before moving on, remove the folder/files pass, fail, and notincluded. 

3.	Run the tracing tool to instrument the program class files: java -jar Tracer.jar [trace options] [soot options] (see the example below). This step only instruments the programs, the traces will be produced when you run the example programs again in step 4.

    **Soot options:** You can use the soot option -process-dir to instrument all class files in a directory. Do this from the base directory, where Tracer.jar is. Replace [trace options] with the options described in the Trace options section below or leave it blank. \
	java -jar Tracer.jar [trace options] -cp ./example_program_1/classes -process-dir ./example_program_1/classes \
	java -jar Tracer.jar [trace options] -cp ./example_program_2/classes -process-dir ./example_program_2/classes
    	
	For more Soot options see: https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/public/origin/develop/soot/soot-develop/options/soot_options.htm 
    
    **Trace options:** There are two methods of tracing. Not specifying any trace options will result in tracing method invocations with arguments and return values.
    
    1\)	Method 1 traces the method invocations in the order that they return to the caller method. 
        *invocations*  - Include the caller and callee method names in the trace lines. 
        *arguments* - Include the arguments values in the trace lines. 
        *return-values* - Include the return values in the trace lines. 
		*encode-unsigned* - Encodes the argument and return values. Encodes strings as byte arrays and converts numbers to their unsigned representation, excluding floats. 
		
	For example, java -jar Tracer.jar invocations arguments -cp ./example_program_1/classes -process-dir ./example_program_1/classes should produce something like:\
		main <init> , rstats2019.xyz \
		main readLine , \
		factory <init> , ABD Aberdeen 3170226 \
		main factory , 8976     ABD     AB11 6LX  ... 
        
    2\)	Method 2 prints any method in the instrumented classes that are executed.
        *visited-methods* - Will specify the use of method 2 and include the function name of the visited methods in the order they are executed.  
	
	For example, java -jar Tracer.jar visited-methods -cp ./example_program_1/classes -process-dir ./example_program_1/classes should produce:\
	main\
	\<init\>\
	readLine\
	factory\
	...
       
    Options that can be used with both methods:  
		*include-class* - Write the methods as: Class.method name.  
		
4.	Produce the traces: Run the compiled output example program like in step 2 form the original program folder, but pointing the classpath to the sootOutput folder:

	For example program 1: It should only take a few seconds to run. \
		Linux: java -cp ../sootOutput:. RunStationStatistics rstats2019.xyz \
		Windows: java -cp "../sootOutput;." RunStationStatistics rstats2019.xyz
	
	For example program 2: Just under 1000 files should be created but it should not take more than one or a few minutes to run. \
	    Linux : java -cp junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0.jar:.:../sootOutput:test-classes/ RunSomeTests \
	    Windows: java -cp "junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0.jar;.;../sootOutput;test-classes/" RunSomeTests
